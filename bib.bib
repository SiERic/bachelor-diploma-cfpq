Some of the program-analysis problems that are amenable to this treatment include program slicing, certain dataflow-analysis problems, one version of the problem of approximating the possible “shapes” that heap-allocated structures in a program can take on, and flow-insensitive points-to analysis. Relationships between graph reachability and other approaches to program analysis are described. Some techniques that go beyond pure graph reachability are also discussed.}

The algorithm is based on a tree structure, and has reduced computation time by 40 percent over a previously published algorithm by identifying all equivalence classes with one scan of the EQUIVALENCE declarations. The method is applicable in any problem in which it is necessary to identify equivalence classes, given the element pairs defining the equivalence relation.},
