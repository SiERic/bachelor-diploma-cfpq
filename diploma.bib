abstract="The context-free language (CFL) reachability problem is well known and studied in computer science, as a fundamental problem underlying many important static analyses such as points-to-analysis. Solving the CFL reachability problem in the general case is very hard. Popular solutions resorting to a graph traversal exhibit a time complexity of O(k3n3) for a grammar of size k. For Dyck CFLs, a particular class of CFLs, this complexity can be reduced to O(kn3). Only recently the first subcubic algorithm was proposed by Chaudhuri, dividing the complexity of predating solutions by a factor of logn.",

All that is necessary for the new bound is a simple adaptation of a known technique. We also show that a better algorithm exists if the input machine does not have infinite recursive loops.},
